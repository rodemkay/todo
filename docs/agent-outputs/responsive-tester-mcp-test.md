## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Bug Description
The MCP Server checkbox selections do not persist correctly when editing an existing TODO. Specifically:
1. **Context7** - Persists correctly ‚úÖ
2. **Playwright** - Does NOT persist (lost) ‚ùå  
3. **Filesystem** - Persists correctly ‚úÖ

### Additional Issues Discovered

#### 1. Checkbox "Select All" Bug
- **Issue:** When clicking on an unchecked MCP server checkbox while others are already checked, ALL checkboxes become selected
- **Expected:** Only the clicked checkbox should toggle
- **Impact:** Makes it difficult to select specific combinations of MCP servers
- **Workaround:** Must manually deselect unwanted checkboxes after the unintended "select all" behavior

#### 2. JavaScript Console Logs
During testing, the following console patterns were observed:
```javascript
[MCP] Defaults loaded: Array
[PROMPT GENERATOR] MCP-Server gefunden: Array
```
These logs appear when checkboxes are clicked, suggesting the system recognizes MCP server changes.

### Generated Claude Prompt Analysis
In the edit form, the generated Claude prompt shows:
```
## üîß MCP SERVER VERF√úGBAR
Du kannst folgende MCP-Server f√ºr diese Aufgabe verwenden:
- **Context7**
- **Filesystem**
```

**Notable Absence:** Playwright is missing from the generated prompt, confirming that the selection was not saved properly.

## Test Environment
- **WordPress Version:** 6.8.2
- **Plugin:** Project To-Dos (TODO Plugin)
- **Browser:** Playwright automation
- **User:** ForexSignale (Admin)

## Screenshots Captured
1. `page-2025-08-26T10-50-22-341Z.png` - Initial default MCP server selections
2. `todo-form-filled-before-save.png` - Form completed with all 3 MCP servers selected
3. `after-save-navigation.png` - Dashboard after successful TODO creation
4. `dashboard-after-scroll.png` - TODO visible in dashboard listing
5. `mcp-persistence-bug-confirmed.png` - Edit form showing only 2 of 3 MCP servers selected

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Fix Required
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Issue:** Playwright MCP server selection not persisting
- **Suggestion:** Check database save/load logic for MCP server selections

### 2. Checkbox UI Improvement
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Clicking unchecked checkbox causes all checkboxes to be selected
- **Suggestion:** Fix JavaScript event handling to only toggle the clicked checkbox

### 3. Data Validation
- **Priority:** MEDIUM  
- **Suggestion:** Add validation to ensure MCP server selections are properly saved before allowing form submission

## Conclusion
The test has successfully **CONFIRMED** the reported persistence issue. The bug affects the Playwright MCP server selection specifically, while Context7 and Filesystem selections persist correctly. This appears to be a database persistence issue rather than a UI display issue, as the generated Claude prompt also reflects the missing Playwright selection.

**Status:** üö® **BUG CONFIRMED** - MCP Server persistence partially failing
**Impact:** Users cannot reliably select and maintain specific MCP server combinations
**Next Steps:** Development team should investigate database save/load logic for MCP server selections
