# Prompt Generator Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The automatic TODO loading system wasn't working because the generated prompts weren't being saved to the database.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Wrong Database Column Name
**File:** `/includes/class-admin.php`  
**Line:** 1923  
**Problem:** The `ajax_save_prompt_output` function was trying to update a non-existent column `prompt_output`  
**Solution:** Changed to update the correct column `claude_prompt`

```php
// Before (WRONG):
['prompt_output' => $prompt_output, 'updated_at' => current_time('mysql')]

// After (CORRECT):
['claude_prompt' => $prompt_output, 'updated_at' => current_time('mysql')]
```

### 2. ⚠️ PARTIAL ISSUE: Auto-Save Overwrites Full Prompt
**Problem:** The auto-save feature (runs every 2 seconds) saves a minimal prompt that overwrites the full generated prompt  
**Impact:** Even though the prompt generator creates a full prompt, the auto-save replaces it with a minimal version  
**Current Behavior:**
- Full prompt is generated correctly in the UI
- Auto-save runs and saves only a minimal version
- When form is submitted, the minimal version is what gets saved

## Test Results

### Created Test TODOs
- TODO #461: Initial test - claude_prompt was NULL
- TODO #462: Second test - claude_prompt was NULL  
- TODO #463: Third test - claude_prompt was NULL
- TODO #464: After removing duplicate handler - claude_prompt was NULL
- TODO #465: Debug test - claude_prompt was NULL
- TODO #466: After fixing ajax_save_prompt_output - claude_prompt was NULL
- TODO #467: Final test - claude_prompt saved but only minimal version (137 chars)

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Prompt generator JavaScript creates full prompts correctly
- Prompts are displayed properly in the UI
- The ajax_save_prompt_output now writes to the correct database column

### ⚠️ Needs Fix
- Auto-save feature needs to be modified to either:
  1. Not save the claude_prompt field at all (only save on form submission)
  2. Save the full generated prompt instead of minimal version
  3. Be disabled for the claude_prompt field specifically

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Disable auto-save for claude_prompt field** in `prompt-generator.js`
2. **Ensure form submission includes full prompt** from the hidden `prompt_output` field
3. **Test that the session watcher can auto-execute** TODOs with proper prompts

## Files Modified
1. `/includes/class-admin.php` - Fixed column name in ajax_save_prompt_output
2. `/admin/new-todo-v2.php` - Removed duplicate form submit handler
3. `/admin/js/prompt-generator.js` - Added debugging and submit handler improvements

## Verification Command
```bash
# Check if TODOs have prompts saved:
ssh rodemkay@100.67.210.46 "cd /var/www/forexsignale/staging && wp db query 'SELECT id, title, LENGTH(claude_prompt) as prompt_length, bearbeiten FROM stage_project_todos WHERE bearbeiten = 1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10'"
```
